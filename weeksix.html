          <strong>This sixth week we dived into 'Tech Beyond the Myth' as the name suggests it goes way beyond what we usually see or believe from technology. We opened up several non working electronics and saw what was hidding inside them. This is one thing I never expected but was so glad we did. We never stop to think about what we consume or the things we buy, where they come from, how they were assembled, who assembled them, how long it took to be assembled, how many parts does it have and most importantly, how does it work. </strong>
          <img src="images/blog/week6/grouptv.jpeg" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>The issue this T.V. had was in the screen, it was broken and you couldn't see the image clearly.</p>
            <img src="images/blog/week6/gifs/pantalla.gif" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-center mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>We opened up the T.V. starting from the back and took a look at all of the little pieces that composed it and made it work. It was definitley impressive getting to know all of the components of a T.V. and what everything does in order to deliver to us an image. We followed the circuits and connections in order to make the forensics report and learn what everything did and the logic behind it. You can read our report in this <a href="https://hackmd.io/k6mQVyogRHG1THKUaOLR9g?both">HackMD file.</a> </p>

          <p>After seeing the backpart and descifering what the PCB's did and where all the cables went, we turned it over and dismantled the screen. We realized that it is composed of several screens that helped diffused the light from below and project the image on the screen. The signal came from the backpart through a PCB that read the signal and transmitted the pixels into the screen. We also did a close up with the microscope into the main screen and saw how all the rgb's were lined up. We also saw the leds that were lighting up the T.V.</p>

             <img src="images/blog/week6/ledbox.jpg" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>In the end we got to open everything and explore all the pieces. It was so interesting to research what some pieces did and where did they come from. We realized most of them came from different brands and countries. We were curious to follow the supply chain and make a map of where all the pieces came from which you can find on our <a href="https://hackmd.io/k6mQVyogRHG1THKUaOLR9g?both">HackMD file.</a></p>
          <blockquote>It is impressive all the amount of work and distribution network built into these electronics that are so common and accesible to us. We absorb the technology immediatly and without consciousness of everything that happens behind stage.</blockquote>
          <p>For the second part of the week we set an objective and a hipothesis to work with in order to collect data. We decided to work with growing our own meals at home or in our neighborhood. We were asking questions like why is organic food so expensive, why does fruit is sold in plastic wrapping, what if we got food without paying money, can we have a balanced diet and grow the ingredients ourselves, and many other questions. These questions led to our hipothesis which was: "I can produce the ingredients of my own meals at home or from my neighborhood.</p>
