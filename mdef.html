        <P>
       During this first week i gained a lot of insights mainly about my fellow students. I absoloutely enjoyed getting to know most of them, although I’m still missing some and I would really like to get to know them more. I think in general we’re all really interesting people with very different backgrounds. I believe collaboration can grow from getting to know each other and our interests, knowledge and skills. </P>

       I got also very excited about this first term when the teachers were explaining it a bit more into detail. Defining what’s my fight is what I find a bit more challenging. I believe I have a lot of concerns in my life and some of them are really big issues I wouldn’t know how to approach. But in a way I’m happy that I get to discuss them with my classmates and friends to find different perspectives and experiences towards them. </P>

       <P>
       What I also found very challenging this first week was the coding of the website. This is my first approach to this language and I honestly feel a bit lost. I’ve set my mind to see more tutorials and experiment more with the program. Also I managed to ask for a bit of help from my classmates which was very nice to have. I really hope (I’m sure) I’ll get better at this, and in a few months I’ll probably laugh back at me.
