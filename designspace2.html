          <strong>For my research I chose to use role number 2 of prototyping which is The prototype as a means of inquiry. I believe this will be useful in my case because I want to gain information on how people feel about interacting with nature and observing it. I am in the search for an activity that can be arecreative for humans but beneficial to the environment. So this is my first approach, using observation and a field trip into the streets and nature to inject data into the scientific community. So for this experiment I asked for the help of my classmates to use the app iNaturalist and take pictures of the species they found around them, post them to the app and identify them.</strong>
          <img src="images/blog/week4/agrisamples-02.png"alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>So the tools they need for the activity were mainly things for observation. To use the app the only thing you need is a pair of eyes and your phone. But to observe nature I made a list of things you could use to anotate and capture what you saw (see fig.1).</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/designspace-03.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>After that I needed to get information out of their activity. So to extract that information first I asked myself what insights I wanted to obtain from this experiment (see fig.2).</p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/designspace-04.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>After writing down all of the questions I wanted to obtain answers to I designed <a class="text-dark" href="https://uhottz0rsjt.typeform.com/to/Q8IIS3Er">'my survey.'</a> The results were <a class="text-dark" href="https://uhottz0rsjt.typeform.com/report/Q8IIS3Er/ASIaNZPPonm1n2xq"> this.</a></p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/survey-01.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
            <img src="images/portfolio/survey-02.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>After doing the activity myself, I realized that this apps or platform are in some way useful and I guess that for the researchers community it's a good data entry point. But for me it still left a lot of missing pieces. The app doesn't display a lot of information about the species, not even if this is the right species when identifying it. What I felt was still missing or I would have loved to know is how can I interact with this species, what does it eat, where does it come from, are there some precautions I should take with it, are they endangered, and so many more questions. So I made a simulation of the information that could be added to the species information card.</p>
          <img src="images/portfolio/designspace-01.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>I also did the next image portraying how you would see it if it was in real time by scanning the species and how can information be portrayed with the help of AR, VR technologies.</p>
          <img src="images/portfolio/designspace-02.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>At this point I was already bummed about how damaging a species we are. And all of the main issues in nature I stumbled upon were mainly man caused. So my conclussion at first was that nature is definitely better without us. Looking at the past two years with covid and how the pandemic actually helped the environment replenish in some ways just reafirmed my theory that what nature need to regenerate is to be as far away as possible from us.</p>
          <p>But that couldn't just be the answer, we've already done so much ireparable damage that we need to at least try to help nature regenerate at a faster speed in order to save some species who have no time. So I researched some of the possible positive actions we can do. One thing we've gotten good at is at data recollection for research. Now with the new technologies we can use them for a positive action and help researchers by injecting information about what we see when we travel. There is a lot of data we can gather from nature in order to help it.</p>
          <p>There is also ecotourism which is defined as "the responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education" (TIES, 2015).But regenerative tourism has to go beyond conservation and dive into regeneration actions. So not just staying with not affecting nature but aiding its restoration. One of the most important actions we can take is the conscious interaction with species. We've grown so distant from our natural habitats, gettinig used to concrete and buildings and traffic and just the buzz of the city that we've forgotten what it is to interact with other species that are not humans or pets.</p>

          <p>There are some examples of projects that are taking action towards a more resilient practice. There is <a class="text-dark" href="https://sustainabletravel.org/">'Sustainable Travel International'</a> which uses travel and tourism to create environmental and social impact in destinations around the world. <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.indagare.com/destinations/world/articles/indagare-impact-sustainable-travel">'Indagare Travel with Impact program '</a> works by organizing trips that have a positive impact on the places they visit. They support local communities and help preserve great cultural sites for future generations while also protecting endangered wildlife and ecosystems. <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.goldstandard.org/">'Gold Standard'</a> helps manage best practices for climate and sustainable development interventions to maximise impact in the world. <a class="text-dark" href="https://verra.org/">'Verra'</a> catalyzes measurable climate action and sustainable development outcomes coming from large investments for projects that promote activities to reduce emissions, improve livelihoods and protect nature. <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.planvivo.org/">'Plan Vivo'</a> provides support to communities on the forefront of the climate crisis, they help protect and restore the environment and tackle climate change. There are also other initiatives like <a class="text-dark" href="https://www.climateactionreserve.org/">'Climate Action Reserve'</a> that is a carbon offset registry for the North American carbon market encouraging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
