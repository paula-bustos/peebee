          <strong>This week we were introduced to concepts like artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural net and more. These refer to a machine that receives instructions (input) and translates them into an action (output). These machines see, create and think. But what does it really mean that it thinks? It doesn't think on it's own, it all just responds to the instructions we give to it. Machine learning responds to training data rather than code, this works by providing examples in order for the machine to automate tasks. In this way you can tell a machine to identify a person, a cat, a man, a table, chair, etc. by providing several expamples (training data) so it has a reference on what the thing it's looking for looks like. Then there's also the neural net which is the web of information that reconfigures itself from examples. You can use different ones depending on what you need it for, like if its for images, text sound or you want to label content or generate images, etc. Then there's the dataset which is the information you're going to feed to the machine. Usually lots of data is needed for a more accurate task. In the dataset is where you find the biases that will also show in the results. This is a very important matter and there have been lots of discussions regarding machine biases which are hard to eliminate and not to be based on them but they're also racist. The training is the configuration of the network based on the dataset we recollected first.</strong>
          
          <p>It's crazy to think how far we've come with technological breakthroughs that we can teach a computer how to do tasks in such a short amount of time. This is definitely making our lives easier but it's also pushing us to think more deeply about the responsibility of our choices and the things we design but also what we consume. One of the excercises we did was with Google Colab. <a href="https://tallerestampa.com/es/">Taller Estampa</a> shared with us a file in which we uploaded a picture and it identified elements in it. Like buses, people, bowls, tables, chairs, handbags and all sorts of things.</p>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/meravalML.jfif" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-center mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>With another document we explored how some images could be generated with machine learning. We explored different "seeds" which is a point in the latent space (refering to an image) and made some remixes between them.</p>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/seedtruncation1.jpeg" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-center mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>This was done with a truncation of 1, meaning it grabs the more "normal" (whatever that means) parameters for the tweaking of the pictures. The next one was done with a truncation of 2. Prepare for the outcome, spoiler alert: it's super creepy.</p>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/seedtruncation2.jpeg" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">

          <p>You can see here how the pictures were mixed and as they had other elements in the picture like hats, microphones, glasses, etc. it just makes a weird combination of it as an output. The last one I did is with a truncation of 3. This last outcome became more abstract rather than defined.</p>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/seedtruncation3.jpeg" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>The dataset used is from Flickr-Faces-HQ and it consists of 70,000 pictures which the code used to generate the new images. After this we uploaded our picture and ran the program to see how it would modify it to make a new image related to yours. So I uploaded my picture and the first result I got was this.</p>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/portraitstweaked-01.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>I noticed that this was an outcome that didn't look like me that much, so I tried uploading another picture to see the outcome it gave.</p>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/portraitstweaked-02.png" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4">
          <p>This was even creepier than the first one. Actually the first time I uploaded this picture it identified one of my hair curls as a face. So I had to upload it again with the picture cropped to my face specifically. I don't know why but when my picture was uploaded the contour was blurred so this did something to the picture and looked for something similar. As you can see in the outcome all around her face is blurred. </p>

          <blockquote>This activity made me think about all the fake information we consume from the internet. It's so easy to make things up which look so real. You can fake so many things and deceive people with this. I guess this is one of the risks of new technology and the internet. We just need to learn how to use it better.</blockquote>
          <p>Another activity that we did was to recollect the last 100 pictures we had in our phones and to take 100 pictures of Poblenou representing its new and its old aspects. In this last pictures we were also looking for them to be heterogeneous so they could be matched together. Taller estampa recollected all of our pictures and added them to <a href="https://tallerestampa.com/treballs/MDEF/phone.html#">this site</a> for the phone ones, and to <a href="https://tallerestampa.com/treballs/MDEF/poblenou.html#">this site</a> for the Poblenou ones. You can see in the following image the map of how the pictures were clustered into categories.</p>
          <p><blockquote>Compillation from Poblenou</blockquote></p>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/clusterpoblenou.jpeg" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-center mr-5 mb-4">
          <p><blockquote>Compillation from Phones</blockquote>
          <img src="images/blog/week8/clusterphones.jpeg" alt="post-thumb" class="img-fluid rounded float-center mr-5 mb-4"></p>
          <p>As you can see, all of the pictures were categorized into clusters in order to organize them. In this way the program found similarities between this images and clustered them into groups. I found it quite funny that a picture of me sticking out my tounge was clustered next to pictures of doors. I guess the color scheme was just very similar to the door ones.</p>
