       Second week has been even more challenging than the first one. I think we're starting to get somewhere with our projects. I still feel like I have too many things in my head yet so little answers. We created a mir√≥ board which I found amazing. There are so many interesting topics I would love to dig into and add to my project, it was so hard just choosing one. I was in between Regenerative Tourism and Cyberbiomes. I think for now I'll go with regenerative tourism because in a way I'm very passionate about travelling and getting to know new places but I'm also conscious of the environmental impact that creates. There is also few information regarding tourism and regeneration so I would like to dig deeper into this. But I also left some other topics on the side I would really like to touch at some point. </P>

         We went to Collserolla park in order to build our multiscalar diagram and have a different perspective on our topic. I have to say that just standing on the top and seeing everything in such scale makes you realize, in case you had forgotten, about how small a part of the planet you are. In the same way we are all so much influential to our environment. It's incredible how nature regenerates and adapts so fast on its own. This only got me thinking while writing notes on my diagram that nature doesn't need us to regenerate, it is actually better without us #sadreactsonly. Which only makes my topic a bit more confusing to me because it is challenging to think about how can we visit natural environments but not only not make a negative impact but also help them regenerate. So yeah I'm still struggling to define how are we going to be able to repair the damage we've caused to our environment so far. I believe it has to do with education, change of habits, being respectful, conscious, dropping man's ego and more things. But at least I know there is something we can (must) do, that's why I'm here.

        Up there we found a conservation group dedicated to observing birds and analiziing their migration paths between other things like also educating people. There is also a dog shelter which takes volunteers for walking some of their dogs. I gotta say I'm impressed with the sense of community in Barcelona and iniciatives that definitely help us take care of the environment. So maybe one solution is to learn about the environment you're about to visit and see what is harmful and what not, what can you do to help that place while you visit it.

         Last Saturday we volunteered for Connecthort and had lots of fun using biomaterials to build a house. I guess this is also part of starting to change habits and ways of impacting the world we live in. For the next steps of this project I would like to contact the team at six n five. They are a group of creatives doing digital visualizations of natural escapes. I haven't figured out how exactly we can collaborate but I have a feeling we can do something related to getting people's interest back into taking care of nature. I also want to try experimenting with natural components growing on their own and analyze what exactly is it that we can do to help nature regenerate or what this word actually means in nature. Is it better to leave it on its own or is there something we humans can contribute towards it. For this I want to grow my biology skills and learn about microorganisms.
