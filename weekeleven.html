          <strong>Analizing existing situations in order to become agents of change.</strong>
          
          <h5>Abstract.</h5>

          <p>Design for me is defined more as a mindset rather than a profession. It is the way we approach things and how we see the world. It is also the way in which we interact with our surrounding environment and how we engage with others. It helps us create bridges between different disciplines and interests. What I love most about design is the exchange of knowledge from different sources. In order to design something you must first start with curiosity, this curiosity will in time become action. Curiosity sparks initiative and motivates you to start looking for ways to improve your surrounding environment. This also comes from discomfort. We as designers have the curse (or blessing) of not being able to conform with things that don’t work properly for us. We tend to look for issues in order to study them carefully and then be able to diagnose them so we can make improvements. As apart of our process we do lots of research to recollect as much information as we can so we can make a more informed approach. This also includes integrating other participants into our design process. This is a key point, inviting others to collaborate with us and gaining more insights will always help you achieve a more complete vision of what is actually needed.</p>

          <p>As designers we strive to improve our ways of living. This can be done by designing systems, products, interactions, spaces, anything. It is most of the times a relation between you and the environment. By changing small things we also contribute to the greater change. There is also a huge responsibility that comes with the task of designing. We have to understand that we change lives. We produce designs that will change how others will live and shape their behavior. This is a great responsibility and we want to impact others in a beneficial way. But we can’t have control over everything that will happen with our designs and how will people use them. We can try our best to study and analyze behaviors and trends in order to make predictions, but the best we can do always is to be conscious of the possible risks our designs may have. Participatory design is a good way to reduce risks. By integrating other members into your design process you gain other insights you may have not noticed or considered. You also get to know better the necessities of the project and who the user is going to be. </p>

          <p>Design can give you the tools to change from being only an observer to becoming an active member of change for your community. This gives you the power to change your circumstances if they are not beneficial for you or others. Designs are ever changing, they keep evolving with time as they adapt to our necessities and requirements. Nothing ever stays the same in nature so a good design needs to keep up with the changes in its environment and become resilient. We as designers also don’t stay the same, if we did then that would mean we haven’t learned anything new with the passing of time. As we grow we gain more knowledge that we transmit into our designs to make improvements to them. In this sense there is never a fully finished design, there are just stages to it. We will always keep thinking of more ways to make it better or to adapt it to our new ways of being. This is what also adds fun and life to design, the challenge of keeping the exploration open to new possibilities. </p>
