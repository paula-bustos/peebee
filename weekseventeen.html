          <strong>Reflecting on the ethics of one's own course project.</strong>
          
          <p>.</p>

          <blockquote>"Sharing is Copying"</blockquote>

          <p>Our daily life shapes us in ways we usually don't realize affects us in a deeper sense. Our society has shaped many things around us that we have had to grow used to and just find ways around us. Civilization is always moving forward and with this inevtibale force of progress a lot a different intrinsic values are written. It is easier to judge others from one's own perspective but hard to do it for one's self when needed. In this case I question myself in which ways is my design ethical. The question of ethics and values is very subjective. But then there's also the cultural, family and educational values that we have to take into account. There are several standards of ethics that are believed to be universal and managed by a set of rules or laws, but they all still differ from country to country. Technologies are a good way to analyze and materialyze the values that a society has. We can call technology many different things and not necessarily things related to electronics. Technologies are the tools we use to enhance an action. We can become part of this technology and integrate it into our bodies, activities, routine and systems. They can be used then in an ethical way or a non-ethical one. But how do we define this thin line?</p>

          <p>People have tried to define this judgement with a lot of ways, one of the tools that help a lot are these <a href="https://ddc.dk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/03_20_questions_from_ethicsprofessor_A4_Engelsk.pdf">questions</a>  you can make yourself to understand if your product/project is ethical or not. You can try to combine your imagination with your current knowledge to have a criteria if wether your project is ethical or not. With these questions I proceeded to question myself and my current course project to see how ethical are they really.</p>

          <p>I'm currently working on a collective called SlowLab. We are focusing on exploring alternatives to our everyday systems which we are so used to and try to provide a change which is less harmful for the natural ecosystems. This involves a change of habits and mindset. We are trying to bring back some ancestral knowledge on how we were using the technologies around us to perform our daily survival activities and we didn't feel the need of another app to guide us through the process. We used to be much more patient and understanding od the things that were happening around us. Now with all the advancements we have it's hard to not think of a smart and advanced way to do stuff. But we never stop to think about the consecuences of our actions and right now the climste es expecting us to act before it's too late. I believe my project could be considered ethical to some extent. We do in fact promote a resilient lifestyle and try to move people towards living a more independent life from fossil fuels and all of this energy providing companies that just have us hooked to them. Some other may consider that we are lacking a lot of things which makes us miss a lot of the ethical questions around us that no one has managed to solve. It is always easier to judge the ones doing an active change than the ones in big company jut adding a green labeel to their products. One of our main concers  is the fact that there's risk while building Solar Ovens and eating something that's not well cooked or that people don't relate to or would never have at home. Aside from that they also need to be user friendly and people would ideally be super happy of pleaying with them. </p>
